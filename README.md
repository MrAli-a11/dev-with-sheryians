# 🚀 Frontend Development Practice Repo

This repository contains my frontend development practice — organized topic-wise — as part of my journey with the **AI-Powered Web + DSA + Aptitude Cohort** by [Sheryians Coding School](https://sheryians.com/).

It includes hands-on practice files, structured code, and folders for upcoming mini-projects. Everything is organized and beginner-friendly for quick navigation and learning.

## 📁 Folder Structure

| Folder           | Description                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `Dom/`           | DOM manipulation practice using HTML, CSS & JavaScript  |
| `OOP/`           | Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript               |
| `Asynchronous/`  | Async JS, Promises, async/await, fetch etc.             |

Each topic contains:
- `practice/` – Hands-on practice (class-wise or topic-wise)
- `project/` – Mini-projects related to the topic _(coming soon)_

## 🧠 Topics Covered So Far

- ✅ DOM Manipulation (Events, Traversing, Styling, etc.)
